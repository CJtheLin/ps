				I enojoy running. In Middle School, I trained for
				long distance. In High School, I started practicing
				sprinting. Thanks to the hard work, I entered the High
				School 4x400 relay team as the first leg. With time of
				3'31, we got first in district and second in state. (I am
				the guy in white shirt). <br>

				Basketball is my favorite sport. When I started playing in 4th grade, I was the worse among my peers. I almost gave up on basketball, but my brothers kept training me. Thanks to them, I was the one of the best basketball player in my middle school.<br>
				I played for my high school in varsity team. Although we didn't win many games, it was precious memory to me.
				I still play basketball in my free time, and I will play until the day my body won't allow me.

				In 2013, I left China and pursued my high school diploma in <a href="https://www.wchsonline.org/" target="-blank">West Christian High School</a> portland OR. I learned a lot in this institution. When I first entered here, I barely know any English and by the time I left, I could speak English fluently. I also made many friends, who I will remember my entire life. In 2016, I graduated as an valedictorian and went to University of Washington.
